# Particle-Charge-Distribution-Calculator

This code calculate non-equilibriumed charge distribution.

## Overall
Following figure shows the particle charging prodedure.  As shown in left side of this figure, z charged particle concentraiton with diameter of dp is given as Nz(t_0) at initial time (t_0).
