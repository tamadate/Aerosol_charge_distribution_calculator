# Particle-Charge-Distribution-Calculator
## Overall
As shown in following figure, this code assume that the particle size distribution is changed by passing through the high concentration ion sppace (i.e., ionizer).  The initial charge distribution is given as Nz(dp,0) and it is changed to Nz(dp,t) by colliding with ions for residence time in the ionizer (t).
## Theory
### Population balance equaiton
The elementary reaction of the charging process is the second order reaction as:
(Az+B->AB)
where A is z charged particle and B is the ion. Hence, the populaiton balance equaiton is given as:
dN/dt=...
Nz is the concentraiton of Az and N+/N- are the positive/negative charged ion concentrations.  Here, the
