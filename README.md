# Particle-Charge-Distribution-Calculator
## Overall
As shown in following figure, this code assume that the particle size distribution is changed by passing through the high concentration ion sppace (i.e., ionizer).  The initial charge distribution of $z$ charged particle is given as $N_z(d_p,0)$ and it is changed to $N_z(d_p,t)$ by colliding with ions for residence time in the ionizer ($t$).
## Theory
### Population balance equaiton
The elementary reaction of the charging process is the second order reaction as:
$$ 
(A^z+B->AB) 
$$
where $A$ is $z$ charged particle and $B$ is the ion. Hence, the populaiton balance equaiton is given as:
$$ dN/dt=... $$
$N_z$ is the concentraiton of $A^z$ and N+/N- are the positive/negative charged ion concentrations.  Here, the
