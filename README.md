# Particle-Charge-Distribution-Calculator
## Overall
As shown in following figure, this code assume that the particle size distribution is changed by passing through the high concentration ion sppace (i.e., ionizer).  The initial charge distribution is given as Nz(dp,0) and it is changed to Nz(dp,t) by colliding with ions for residence time in the ionizer (t).
## Theory
The particle is not
